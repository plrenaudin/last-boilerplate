# Last boilerplate (Hopefully!)

## Stack

- Svelte
- Prettier
- Eslint
- Rollup

## Developper experience first

- Staged code linted and formatted on commit (husky pre-commit + lint staged)
  - For svelte files too (thanks to eslint-plugin-svelte3 and prettier-plugin-svelte)
- Most of the config in one place (package.json)
- Focus on code (less noise as possible)
