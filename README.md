# Last boilerplate (WIP)

## Stack

- Svelte
- Prettier
- Eslint
- Rollup
- Tailwindcss
- Jest

## Developper experience first

- Staged code linted and formatted on commit (husky pre-commit + lint staged)
  - For svelte files too (thanks to eslint-plugin-svelte3 and prettier-plugin-svelte)
- Most of the config in one place (package.json)
- Focus on code (reduced as much noise as possible)

## VSCode

For improved developer experience, install Svelte (jamesbirtles.svelte-vscode) and Prettier (esbenp.prettier-vscode) Extensions

## TODO

- API / backend
- Styling (CSS / SCSS / other?)
